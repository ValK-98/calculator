# The Odin Project - Calculator project


This was by far one of the hardest projects I've done to date! 
I have a couple of stretch goals I need to do, such as keyboard support and possibly a cosmetic overhaul.
I decided to come back later to the project once I have more skills as it proved more difficult than I had hoped.
However, I am quite proud of myself for finish it, although I ended up looking at Youtube videos to get an idea how to progress as I was stuck for over a week.

In retrospective I'll avoid doing this in future as it took the satisfaction away, however it proved to be a valuable learning experience as I had not
planned sufficiently ahead, nor did I approach the project correctly. 
For future projects I now know to approach them by taking small steps by making simple functions and finally putting them all together.
My newest project, the Book Library is considering easier due to my structured approach.
